# 📦 E-commerce Fraud Detection Analysis

Detecting fraudulent transactions is a critical challenge in the e-commerce industry. This project leverages advanced data science and machine learning techniques to build a robust fraud detection pipeline, helping businesses minimize losses and protect customers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this notebook, we:

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and insights from e-commerce transaction data
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Engineer features suitable for fraud classification
- Train and evaluate machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions
- Visualize results and present recommendations

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** Synthetic dataset created for demonstration purposes

**Description:** The dataset simulates e-commerce transactions, with features representing transaction amounts, payment methods, user behavior, and fraud labels.

| Column Name       | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `transaction_id`  | Unique identifier for each transaction           |
| `user_id`         | Unique identifier for each user                  |
| `amount`          | Transaction amount                               |
| `payment_method`  | Payment method used (e.g., credit card, PayPal)  |
| `device_type`     | Device used to perform the transaction           |
| `transaction_time`| Timestamp of transaction                         |
| `is_fraud`        | 0 = genuine, 1 = fraudulent                      |

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Correct data types
2. **EDA**
   - Visualize fraud vs. non-fraud distributions
   - Study user and transaction patterns
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize transaction amounts
4. **Model Building**
   - Random Forest Classifier (primary model)
   - Cross-validation for tuning
5. **Evaluation**
   - Classification report (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
   - Confusion matrix
   - ROC-AUC analysis
6. **Insights & Recommendations**

## 📈 Results

The Random Forest Classifier showed promising results with high precision and recall, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent e-commerce transactions.

Key takeaways:

✅ Fraudulent transactions often showed distinct patterns in amount and device usage  
✅ Imbalanced classes were handled carefully to avoid bias  
✅ Feature engineering significantly improved model performance
